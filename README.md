## Overview
Humanity Resonance is a **sovereign, single-file dashboard** — a self-contained HTML application designed to monitor, verify, and forecast global systemic signals in real time.  
Built entirely in one file (`index.html`), it integrates **50 live KPIs** across health, finance, energy, climate, logistics, and governance — with anomaly detection, zero-proof integrity checks, and predictive analytics.

This is not just a dashboard.  
It is a **strategic global interface** — combining science, sovereignty, and human-centric design to deliver clarity in moments of uncertainty.

- **Realtime Lead–Lag Causality Pulse** — uncover propagation chains.  
- **Anomaly Atlas** — z-score anomalies grouped by systemic domain.  
- **Integrity Watchtower** — zero-proof packet hash + Merkle root verification.  
- **Resilience Radar** — system-wide adaptive capacity view.  
- **Global Stress Map** — hotspot visualization of cascading risks.  
- **One-File Architecture** — no dependencies, no CDNs, no external libraries.
